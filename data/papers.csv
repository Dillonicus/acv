Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review comparing patients with bladder cancer requiring RC and prior history of XRT for prostate cancer to those undergoing RC without XRT history at our institution from 2011-2018. Propensity score matching was performed with the following variables: age, chronic kidney disease, nutritional deﬁciency, neoadjuvant chemotherapy use, Charlson comorbidity index, surgical approach, urinary diversion type, and pathologic T-stage. Perioperative, pathologic and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Categorical variables were assessed utilizing the Pearson Chi Square Test, and continuous variables with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The Kaplan-Meier method with stratiﬁed-log rank was used to compare survival outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to identify predictors of overall and recurrence free survival. Results: 227 patients were included, of which 47 had radiotherapy for prostate cancer. 47% of patients in the radiation cohort received external beam radiation therapy, 47% received brachytherapy and 7% received both. There were no differences in recurrence-free survival (P = 0.82) or overall survival (P = 0.25). Statistically signiﬁcant differences in perioperative or postoperative outcomes such as 90-day complication, readmission, mortality rates, or ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture rates were not found. Rates of node-positive disease, median lymph node yield, positive surgical margin rates, lymphovascular invasion, or variant histology were not signiﬁcantly different between cohorts. Conclusions: After matching for T-stage and other clinical variables, history of pelvic XRT for prostate cancer in patients who later required RC for bladder cancer, was not associated with an increased rate of perioperative complications or an independent predictor of RFS or OS.

The literature suggests “large” cribriform glands associate with aggressive behavior; however, published studies use varying definitions for “large”. We aimed to identify an outcome-based quantitative cut-off for “large” vs “small” cribriform glands. We conducted an initial training phase using the tissue microarray based Canary retrospective radical prostatectomy cohort. Of 1287 patients analyzed, cribriform growth was observed in 307 (24%). Using Kaplan–Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival curves (RFS) that were stratified by cribriform gland size, we identified 0.25 mm as the optimal cutoff to identify more aggressive disease. In univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, size >0.25 mm was a significant predictor of worse RFS compared to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm, independent of pre-operative PSA, grade, stage and margin status (               p                < 0.001). In addition, two different subset analyses of low-intermediate risk cases (cases with Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 = 7; and cases with Gleason score = 3 + 4 = 7/4 + 3 = 7) likewise demonstrated patients with largest cribriform diameter >0.25 mm had a significantly lower RFS relative to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm (each subset               p                = 0.004). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in outcomes between patients with cribriform glands ≤ 0.25 mm and patients without cribriform glands. The >0.25 mm cut-off was validated as statistically significant in a separate 419 patient, completely embedded whole-section radical prostatectomy cohort by biochemical recurrence, metastasis-free survival, and disease specific death, even when cases with admixed Gleason pattern 5 carcinoma were excluded. In summary, our findings support reporting cribriform gland size and identify 0.25 mm as an optimal outcome-based quantitative measure for defining “large” cribriform glands. Moreover, cribriform glands >0.25 mm are associated with potential for metastatic disease independent of Gleason pattern 5 adenocarcinoma.","2022-02-10","2022-03-04 03:23:19","2022-03-04 03:23:19","2022-03-04 03:23:19","","","","","","Mod Pathol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\corrigd3\Zotero\storage\X29CKQAR\Chan et al. - 2022 - Analysis of separate training and validation radic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
