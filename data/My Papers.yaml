    Abstract
                
                  Cribriform growth pattern is well-established as an adverse pathologic feature in prostate cancer. The literature suggests “large” cribriform glands associate with aggressive behavior; however, published studies use varying definitions for “large”. We aimed to identify an outcome-based quantitative cut-off for “large” vs “small” cribriform glands. We conducted an initial training phase using the tissue microarray based Canary retrospective radical prostatectomy cohort. Of 1287 patients analyzed, cribriform growth was observed in 307 (24%). Using Kaplan–Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival curves (RFS) that were stratified by cribriform gland size, we identified 0.25 mm as the optimal cutoff to identify more aggressive disease. In univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, size >0.25 mm was a significant predictor of worse RFS compared to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm, independent of pre-operative PSA, grade, stage and margin status (
                  p
                   < 0.001). In addition, two different subset analyses of low-intermediate risk cases (cases with Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 = 7; and cases with Gleason score = 3 + 4 = 7/4 + 3 = 7) likewise demonstrated patients with largest cribriform diameter >0.25 mm had a significantly lower RFS relative to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm (each subset
                  p
                   = 0.004). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in outcomes between patients with cribriform glands ≤ 0.25 mm and patients without cribriform glands. The >0.25 mm cut-off was validated as statistically significant in a separate 419 patient, completely embedded whole-section radical prostatectomy cohort by biochemical recurrence, metastasis-free survival, and disease specific death, even when cases with admixed Gleason pattern 5 carcinoma were excluded. In summary, our findings support reporting cribriform gland size and identify 0.25 mm as an optimal outcome-based quantitative measure for defining “large” cribriform glands. Moreover, cribriform glands >0.25 mm are associated with potential for metastatic disease independent of Gleason pattern 5 adenocarcinoma.

    Objectives: To determine the impact of prior pelvic radiation therapy (XRT)
    on outcomes following radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer. Materials
    and methods: We performed a retrospective review comparing patients with
    bladder cancer requiring RC and prior history of XRT for prostate cancer to
    those undergoing RC without XRT history at our institution from 2011-2018.
    Propensity score matching was performed with the following variables: age,
    chronic kidney disease, nutritional deﬁciency, neoadjuvant chemotherapy use,
    Charlson comorbidity index, surgical approach, urinary diversion type, and
    pathologic T-stage. Perioperative, pathologic and oncologic outcomes were
    analyzed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Categorical
    variables were assessed utilizing the Pearson Chi Square Test, and
    continuous variables with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The Kaplan-Meier
    method with stratiﬁed-log rank was used to compare survival outcomes.
    Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to identify
    predictors of overall and recurrence free survival.

    Results: 227 patients were included, of which 47 had radiotherapy for
    prostate cancer. 47% of patients in the radiation cohort received external
    beam radiation therapy, 47% received brachytherapy and 7% received both.
    There were no differences in recurrence-free survival (P = 0.82) or overall
    survival (P = 0.25). Statistically signiﬁcant differences in perioperative
    or postoperative outcomes such as 90-day complication, readmission,
    mortality rates, or ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture rates were not
    found. Rates of node-positive disease, median lymph node yield, positive
    surgical margin rates, lymphovascular invasion, or variant histology were
    not signiﬁcantly different between cohorts.

    Conclusions: After matching for T-stage and other clinical variables,
    history of pelvic XRT for prostate cancer in patients who later required RC
    for bladder cancer, was not associated with an increased rate of
    perioperative complications or an independent predictor of RFS or OS. Ó 2021
